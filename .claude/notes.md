# Claude

Currently using the free chat option so it's a little clunkier to manage but also free and also keeps it from just being Claude writing code and my brain rotting.

## Browser Chat to Markdown

Claude chat is limited to 20000 lines of content per chat and then each new chat the context is lost.  The script in here works in the browser to pull a chat and turn it into Markdown.  Then my plan is to have Claude turn that into smaller blocks to give future chat's context about what is going on.
