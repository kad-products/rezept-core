# Roles

## Admin

This is for us folks that are running things.  For now just editing the DB directly to set this role.  Ewww... but oh well. 

## Basic

Just a name for the most basic of logged in users. They can manage their own things but that is pretty much all.  Maybe comments on their own recipes and stuff. 

## Public

Non-logged in users.
