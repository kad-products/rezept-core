## Future Considerations

### Things We Might Add

- API routes (if needed for mobile app)
- Rate limiting (if abuse becomes an issue)
- Caching layer (if performance degrades)
- More complex auth (roles, permissions)
- File uploads (images for recipes)

### Things We Won't Add (Yet)

- Microservices (overkill for this scale)
- GraphQL (server actions + TypeScript are simpler)
- Complex state management (React state + server actions work fine)
- Real-time features (no requirement yet)
