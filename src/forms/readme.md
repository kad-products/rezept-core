# Forms

These are the client-side forms for user interactions.  They should all be `use client`-defined, will be provided the data from server components, and pass data to functions to save.

## Areas of Responsibility

- ✅ Handle browser-level validations
- ✅ Handle React state changes and interactivity
- ✅ Handle standard server function calls and responses
